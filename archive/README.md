## Usage Notes

1. **For historical reference only** - These documents reflect the development process and are not required for using or understanding the current codebase.

2. **Consolidated documentation** - Read `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` for a complete chronological overview instead of individual reports.

3. **Current documentation** - Refer to the main project `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root for up-to-date information.

## Archive Policy

This directory is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to keep the production repository clean. These files are retained locally for:

- Historical reference
- Development process documentation
- Performance benchmark comparisons
- Feature evolution tracking
